Large-Language-Models (LLMs) are powerful AI models that can generate natural language texts and programming code for various purposes and tasks. Students in higher education use tools like ChatGPT already to learn and create projects in various fields. However, not all subjects are equally affected by these tools.

The subjects that are most transformed by Large Language Models are as the name suggest languages. But also programming can be considered a language hence the term programming language used in computer science (cs).
The field of cs benefits immensely and one could argue it is truly transformed by these tools because of several factors that we will explore in detail later. 

Therefore, educators, pupils and schools should also have access to these tools, but not simply by access to it via a chat interface that can't be modefied but instead in a way that suits the specific needs aof schools, educators and pupils.

To explore the benefits of LLMs tailor made for education the aim of this project is to develop a flexible Intelligent-Tutoring-Systems (ITS) for K-12 students that focuses on cs as a subject that could benefits the most from a personalised digital Tutor.
